Version 3.0 (Current) — Part 3: Accessibility, Structure & Content Refinement

🧩 Accessibility Enhancements
- Added WCAG-friendly heading structure (`<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>`) for improved screen reader navigation.
- Introduced a “Skip to Main Content” link for better keyboard accessibility.
- Applied ARIA labels (`aria-labelledby`, `aria-current`) for clear navigation and section identification.
- Ensured all images include meaningful alt text for inclusivity and SEO.

🏗️ Semantic Structure Improvements
- Implemented semantic HTML landmarks: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
- Reorganized content into clear, labeled sections (Hero, Mission, Program Quality, Organization, Footer).
- Created consistent `.container` and `.grid` layouts across all sections.
- Converted “Mission & Principles” into a numbered card-based ordered list (`<ol>`) for easier styling and structure.

🔍 SEO & Performance Optimization
- Consolidated and cleaned duplicate meta tags (single `<meta charset>` + `<meta viewport>`).
- Added canonical link and Open Graph (OG) metadata for better search and social sharing.
- Enabled lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) and specified `width`/`height` for all images to reduce layout shift.
- Improved page `<title>` and meta descriptions for stronger SEO performance.

🧭 Navigation & Footer Upgrades
- Replaced invalid `<a><button></button></a>` structure with a semantic anchor link button (`.btn.btn-primary`).
- Wrapped site logo in a branded link pointing to Home (index.html).
- Refined footer structure into three semantic areas:
  - About Section (organization summary)
  - Quick Links (site navigation)
  - Contact Information (email, phone, and address)
- Added accessible text labels for social links, ready for icon styling via CSS.

⚙️ General Refinements
- Removed JavaScript to keep the About page strictly HTML + CSS only.
- Simplified repetitive wording for a cleaner, more professional tone.
- Verified internal links and filenames for consistency (`about_us.html`, `Enquiry.html`, etc.).
- Validated final HTML for W3C compliance and ensured cross-browser stability.
