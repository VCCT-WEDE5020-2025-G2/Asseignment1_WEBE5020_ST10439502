            <h2>About Hope Haven</h2>
            <p>Hope Haven is the second oldest community program for individuals with developmental disabilities in the state of Georgia. It has grown over the decades thanks to the generous support of the Athens community and the dedication of its staff, board members, and volunteers.</p>

            <h2>History Timeline</h2>
            <p>Hope Haven began in the homes of five families in 1958, initially surviving through individual donations. In 1962, it became an agency of the Athens Community Chest, now known as the United Way of Northeast Georgia. The program expanded further in 1972 through state funding and contracts with the Georgia Department of Human Resources, enabling services for more individuals. A respite home serving 10 counties opened in June 1995.</p>

            <p>In October 1997, Hope Haven proudly occupied its main center at 795 Newton Bridge Road. This facility was funded through decades of donations and the generous bequest of the Henson family.</p>

            <p>In September 2009, a new facility for respite services named Leeâ€™s House opened at 200 Vincent Drive, in memory of Lee Florence. This was made possible by the support of the Florence family, the Ramser family, and other community supporters.</p>
